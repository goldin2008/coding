    "This post guides you through the process of assessing quality of RAG response with evaluation framework such as RAGAS and LlamaIndex with Amazon Bedrock.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we are also going to leverage Langchain to create a sample RAG application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon `Bedrock` is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing Foundation Models (FMs) from leading AI companies like AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Stability AI, and Amazon via a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities you need to build generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Retrieval Augmented Generation Assessment (`RAGAS`) framework offers multiple metrics to evaluate each part of the RAG system pipeline, identifying areas for improvement. It utilizes foundation models to test individual components, aiding in pinpointing modules for development to enhance overall results.\n",
    "\n",
    "`LlamaIndex` is a framework for building LLM applications. It simplifies data integration from various sources and provides tools for data indexing, engines, agents, and application integrations. Optimized for search and retrieval, it streamlines querying LLMs and retrieving documents. This blog post focuses on using its Observability/Evaluation modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "`LangChain` is an open-source framework that simplifies the creation of applications powered by foundation models. It provides tools for chaining LLM operations, managing context, and integrating external data sources. LangChain is primarily used for building chatbots, question-answering systems, and other AI-driven applications that require complex language processing capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution consists of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Evaluation dataset` – The source data for the RAG comes from the Amazon SageMaker FAQ, which represents 170 question-answer pairs. This corresponds to Step 1 in the architecture diagram.\n",
    "2. `Build sample RAG` – Documents are segmented into chunks and stored in an Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases (Steps 2–4). We use Langchain Retrieval Q&A to answer user queries. This process retrieves relevant data from an index at runtime and passes it to the Foundation Model (FM).\n",
    "3. `RAG evaluation` – To assess the quality of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution, we can use both RAGAS and LlamaIndex. An LLM performs the evaluation by comparing its predictions with ground truths (Steps 5–6).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "To implement this solution, you need the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "An AWS account with privileges to create AWS Identity and Access Management (`IAM`) roles and policies. For more information, see Overview of access management: Permissions and policies.\n",
    "Access enabled for the `Amazon Titan Embeddings G1 – Text model and Anthropic Claude 3 Sonnet` on `Amazon Bedrock`. For instructions, see Model access.\n",
    "Run the prerequisite code provided in the Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation of RAG with RAGAS\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating the RAG solution requires to compare LLM predictions with ground truth answers. To do so, we use the batch() function from LangChain to perform inference on all questions inside our evaluation dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can use the evaluate() function from RAGAS to perform evaluation on each metric (answer relevancy, faithfulness and answer corectness). It uses an LLM to compute metrics. Feel free to use other Metrics from RAGAS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation of RAG with LlamaIndex\n",
    "LlamaIndex, similar to Ragas, provides a comprehensive RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) evaluation module. This module offers a variety of metrics to assess the performance of your RAG system. The evaluation process generates two key outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Feedback`: The judge LLM (Language Model) provides detailed evaluation feedback in the form of a string, offering qualitative insights into the system’s performance.\n",
    "2. `Score`: This numerical value indicates how well the answer meets the evaluation criteria. The scoring system varies depending on the specific metric being evaluated. For example, metrics like Answer Relevancy and Faithfulness are typically scored on a scale from 0 to 1.\n",
    "These outputs allow for both qualitative and quantitative assessment of your RAG system’s performance, enabling you to identify areas for improvement and track progress over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chunking\n",
    "1. Standard chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Bedrock supports the following standard approaches to chunking:\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixed-size chunking: You can configure the desired chunk size by specifying the number of tokens per chunk, and an overlap percentage, providing flexibility to align with your specific requirements. You can set the maximum number of tokens that must not exceed for a chunk and the overlap percentage between consecutive chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Default chunking: Splits content into text chunks of approximately 300 tokens. The chunking process honors sentence boundaries, ensuring that complete sentences are preserved within each chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Hierarchical chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical chunking involves organizing information into nested structures of child and parent chunks. When creating a data source, you are able to define the parent chunk size, child chunk size and the number of tokens overlapping between each chunk. During retrieval, the system initially retrieves child chunks, but replaces them with broader parent chunks so as to provide the model with more comprehensive context.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Semantic chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic chunking is a natural language processing technique that divides text into meaningful chunks to enhance understanding and information retrieval. It aims to improve retrieval accuracy by focusing on the semantic content rather than just syntactic structure. By doing so, it may facilitate more precise extraction and manipulation of relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "> https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-chunking.html#kb-hiearchical-chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAG evaluation concepts and metrics\n",
    "> https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/evaluate-the-reliability-of-retrieval-augmented-generation-applications-using-amazon-bedrock/\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, RAG-based generative AI application is composed of two main processes: retrieval and generation. Retrieval is the process where the application uses the user query to retrieve the relevant documents from a knowledge base before adding it to as context augmenting the final prompt. Generation is the process of generating the final response from the LLM. It’s important to monitor and evaluate both processes because they impact the performance and reliability of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating RAG systems at scale requires an automated approach to extract metrics that are quantitative indicators of its reliability. Generally, the metrics to look for are grouped by main RAG components or by domains. Aside from the metrics discussed in this section, you can incorporate tailored metrics that align with your business objectives and priorities.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Retrieval metrics`\n",
    "You can use the following retrieval metrics:\n",
    "    - `Context relevance` – This measures whether the passages or chunks retrieved by the RAG system are relevant for answering the given query, without including extraneous or irrelevant details. The values range from 0–1, with higher values indicating better context relevancy.\n",
    "    - `Context recall` – This measures the alignment between the context and the expected RAG output, the ground truth. Similar to faithfulness, each statement in the ground truth is checked to see if it is attributed to the context (thereby evaluating the context).\n",
    "    - `Context precision` – This evaluates the relevancy of the context to the answer, or in other words, the retriever’s ability to capture the best context to answer your query. An LLM verifies if the information in the given context is directly relevant to the question with a single “Yes” or “No” response. The context is passed in as a list, so if the list is size one (one chunk), then the metric for context precision is either 0 (representing the context isn’t relevant to the question) or 1 (representing that it is relevant). If the context list is greater than one (or includes multiple chunks), then context precision is between 0–1, representing a specific weighted average precision calculation. This involves the context precision of the first chunk being weighted heavier than the second chunk, which itself is weighted heavier than the third chunk, and onwards, taking into account the ordering of the chunks being outputted as contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Generation metrics`\n",
    "You can use the following generation metrics:\n",
    "    - `Faithfulness` – This measures the factual consistency of the generated answer against the given context, so it requires the answer and retrieved context as an input. This is a two-step prompt where the generated answer is first broken down into multiple standalone statements and propositions. Then, the evaluation LLM validates the attribution of the generated statement to the context. If the attribution can’t be validated, it’s assumed that the statement is at risk of hallucination. The answer is scaled to a 0–1 range; the higher the better.\n",
    "    - `Answer relevance` – This focuses on how pertinent the generated RAG output (answer) is to the question. A lower score is assigned to answers that are incomplete or contain redundant information. To calculate this score, the LLM is asked to generate multiple questions from a given answer. Then using an Amazon Titan Embeddings model, embeddings are generated for the generated question and the actual question. The metric therefore is the mean cosine similarity between all the generated questions and the actual question.\n",
    "    - `Answer semantic similarity` – It compares the meaning and content of a generated answer with a reference or ground truth answer. It evaluates how closely the generated answer matches the intended meaning of the ground truth answer. The score ranges from 0–1, with higher scores indicating greater semantic similarity between the two answers. A score of 1 means that the generated answer conveys the same meaning as the ground truth answer, whereas a score of 0 suggests that the two answers have completely different meanings. This assesses the semantic similarity between the RAG output (answer) and expected answer (ground truth), with a range between 0–1. A higher score signifies better performance. First, the embeddings of answer and ground truth are created, and then a score between 0–1 is predicted, representing the semantic similarity of the embeddings using a cross encoder Tiny BERT model.\n",
    "    - `Answer correctness` – This is the accuracy between the generated answer and the ground truth. This is calculated from the semantic similarity metric between the answer and the ground truth in addition to a factual similarity by looking at the context. A threshold value is used if you want to employ a binary 0 or 1 answer correctness score, otherwise a value between 0–1 is generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Aspects evaluation`\n",
    "Aspects are evaluated as follows:\n",
    "    - `Harmfulness` (Yes, No) – If the generated answer carries the risk of causing harm to people, communities, or more broadly to society\n",
    "    - `Maliciousness` (Yes, No) – If the submission intends to harm, deceive, or exploit users\n",
    "    - `Coherence` (Yes, No) – If the generated answer presents ideas, information, or arguments in a logical and organized manner\n",
    "    - `Correctness` (Yes, No) – If the generated answer is factually accurate and free from errors\n",
    "    - `Conciseness` (Yes, No) – If the submission conveys information or ideas clearly and efficiently, without unnecessary or redundant details\n",
    "\n",
    "`Generator quality` can be assessed through several key metrics. `Context utilization` examines how effectively the generator uses relevant information from the provided source material. `Noise sensitivity` gauges the generator’s propensity to include inaccurate details from the retrieved content. `Hallucination` measures the extent to which the generator produces incorrect claims not present in the source data. `Self-knowledge` reflects the proportion of accurate statements generated that can’t be found in the retrieved chunks. Finally, `faithfulness` evaluates how closely the generator’s output aligns with the information contained in the source material.\n",
    "\n",
    "For measuring the `overall generation quality`, the key metrics include measuring the `precision`, `recall`, and `answer similarity`. `Precision` suggests the proportion of the correct claims in model’s response, whereas `recall` suggests the proportion of the ground truth claims covered by the model’s response. `Answer similarity` compares the meaning and content of a generated answer with a reference or ground truth answer. It evaluates how closely the generated answer matches the intended meaning of the ground truth answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Establishing a feedback loop with an evaluation framework against these quality metrics allows for continuous improvement, where the system can learn from user interactions and refine its performance over time. By optimizing these quality metrics, the RAG system can be designed to deliver reliable, cost-effective, and high-performing results for users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Responsible AI\n",
    "Implementing responsible AI practices is crucial for maintaining ethical and safe deployment of RAG systems. This includes using guardrails to filter harmful content, deny certain topics, mask sensitive information, and ground responses in verified sources to reduce hallucinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use Amazon Bedrock Guardrails for implementing responsible AI policies. Along with protecting against toxicity and harmful content, it can also be used for Automated Reasoning checks, which helps you protect against hallucinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cost and latency\n",
    "Cost considers the compute resources and infrastructure required to run the system, and latency evaluates the response times experienced by end-users. To `optimize cost and latency`, implement `caching strategies` to reduce the need for expensive model inferences. Efficient `query batching` can also improve overall `throughput` and reduce resource usage. Balance performance and resource usage to find the ideal configuration that meets your application’s requirements."

    "### Hosting and scaling\n",
    "When it comes to hosting your web application or service, there are several approaches to consider. The key is to choose a solution that can effectively host your database and compute infrastructure. This could include server-based options like Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), managed services like Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) and Amazon DynamoDB, or serverless approaches such as AWS Amplify and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). For a practical approach to building an automated AI assistant using Amazon ECS, see Develop a fully automated chat-based assistant by using Amazon Bedrock agents and knowledge bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the server or compute layer, you will also need to consider an orchestration tool, testing environments, and a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to streamline your application deployment. Having a feedback loop established based on the quality metrics along with a CI/CD pipeline is an important first step to creating self-healing architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "As your application grows, you will need to make sure your infrastructure can scale to meet the increasing demand. This can involve containerization with Docker or choosing serverless options, implementing load balancing, setting up auto scaling, and choosing between on-premises, cloud, or hybrid solutions. It also includes unique scaling requirements of your frontend application and backend generative AI workflow, as well as the use of content delivery networks (CDNs) and disaster recovery and backup strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a sample architecture for a secure and scalable RAG-based web application. This architecture uses Amazon ECS for hosting the service, Amazon CloudFront as a CDN, AWS WAF as a firewall, and Amazon MemoryDB for providing a semantic cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](pic/POC-TO-Productin-Blog-Architecture.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data privacy, security, and observability\n",
    "Maintaining data privacy and security is of utmost importance. This includes implementing security measures at each layer of your application, from encrypting data in transit to setting up robust authentication and authorization controls. It also involves focusing on compute and storage security, as well as network security. Compliance with relevant regulations and regular security audits are essential. Securing your generative AI system is another crucial aspect. By default, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases encrypts the traffic using AWS managed AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys. You can also choose customer managed KMS keys for more control over encryption keys. For more information on application security, refer to Safeguard a generative AI travel agent with prompt engineering and Amazon Bedrock Guardrails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comprehensive logging, monitoring, and maintenance are crucial to maintaining a healthy infrastructure. This includes setting up structured logging, centralized log management, real-time monitoring, and strategies for system updates and migrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "By addressing these critical areas, you can build a secure and resilient infrastructure to support your growing web application or service. Stay tuned for more in-depth coverage of these topics in upcoming blog posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using purpose-built tools like Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases to streamline the end-to-end RAG workflow, organizations can successfully transition their RAG-powered proofs of concept into high-performing, cost-effective, secure production-ready solutions that deliver business value."

It uses AWS serverless technologies, allowing you to build and run your application without having to manage your own servers. All server management is done by AWS, providing many benefits such as automatic scaling and built-in high availability, letting you take your idea to production quickly."

    "In Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the Retriever and Reranker work together to efficiently and accurately fetch and prioritize relevant information for a language model (LM) to generate high-quality responses. Here's how they function, focusing on bi-encoders (Retriever) and cross-encoders (Reranker):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Retriever (Bi-Encoder)\n",
    "Role:\n",
    "Quickly fetch a subset of candidate documents/passages from a large corpus (e.g., millions of entries) that are potentially relevant to a query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Architecture:\n",
    "Uses two separate neural networks (or one shared network) to independently encode the query and document into dense vector representations (embeddings).\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarity is computed via cosine similarity or dot product between the query and document embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features:\n",
    "Efficiency: Document embeddings can be precomputed and stored, enabling fast approximate nearest neighbor search (e.g., with FAISS or Annoy).\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence: Query and document are processed separately, so no direct interaction is modeled during encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: Ideal for large-scale retrieval tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training:\n",
    "Trained with contrastive loss to maximize similarity between relevant query-document pairs and minimize similarity for irrelevant pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example models: Sentence-BERT, DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval).\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "Less nuanced relevance scoring since query-document interactions are not modeled during encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reranker (Cross-Encoder)\n",
    "Role:\n",
    "Re-score and reorder the top candidate documents (e.g., 100-200) retrieved by the bi-encoder to improve precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Architecture:\n",
    "Processes the query and document together in a single forward pass by concatenating them into one input sequence (e.g., [CLS] query [SEP] document [SEP]).\n",
    "\n",
    "Outputs a relevance score (e.g., via a classification or regression head).\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features:\n",
    "Accuracy: Captures fine-grained interactions between query and document tokens (e.g., attention mechanisms in transformers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational Cost: Expensive for large datasets, as each query-document pair must be processed individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: Can incorporate task-specific relevance signals (e.g., semantic matching, keyword overlap).\n",
    "\n",
    "Training:\n",
    "Trained on binary classification (relevant/irrelevant) or regression (relevance score) using query-document pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example models: Fine-tuned BERT, RoBERTa, or DeBERTa.\n",

    "\n",
    "Query: \"What causes climate change?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Bi-encoder embeds the query and retrieves 100 candidate passages from a pre-indexed corpus (e.g., Wikipedia).\n",
    "\n",
    "Reranking (Cross-Encoder):\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-encoder processes the query with each of the 100 candidates, generating a relevance score for each.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reranks candidates based on scores, selecting the top 5 most relevant passages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The LM (e.g., GPT-4, Llama) uses the top-ranked passages to generate an informed answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Why Use Both?\n",
    "Efficiency-Accuracy Trade-off:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bi-encoders enable fast retrieval from massive corpora.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-encoders add precision by refining the top candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost-Effectiveness:\n",
    "\n",
