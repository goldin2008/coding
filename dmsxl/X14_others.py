Basics of Bit Manipulation

https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/basic-programming/bit-manipulation/basics-of-bit-manipulation/tutorial/

by applying (id+1)^1-1, you toggle the LSB of the input number, which changes odd numbers to even and even numbers to odd. 
This operation works because it takes advantage of the properties of bitwise XOR and subtraction to toggle and reset the LSB, respectively.

#X4 To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers, we can use the Euclidean Algorithm
    # Euclidean Algorithm
    # The algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. Here's how it works:
    # Divide: Divide the larger number by the smaller number.
    # Remainder: Take the remainder of the division.
    # Repeat: Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder.
    # Stop: When the remainder is 0, the smaller number at that step is the GCD.
# Explanation of the Code
# The function gcd(a, b) takes two integers as input.
# It uses a while loop to repeatedly apply the Euclidean Algorithm until b becomes 0.
# In each iteration:
# a is replaced with b.
# b is replaced with the remainder of a % b.
# When b becomes 0, the loop ends, and a is returned as the GCD.
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b  # Replace a with b, and b with the remainder of a divided by b
    return a
# Example usage
print(gcd(56, 98))  # Output: 14
