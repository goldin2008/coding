Number of wire inbound transactions is the most significant contributor to the risk score, accounting for 52% of the total risk. A high number of inbound wire transactions can be indicative of unusual or suspicious activity, especially if the volume is significantly higher than typical patterns for similar entities.
Percentage of wire amount associated with HRG country: Contributing 36% to the risk score, this feature highlights the proportion of wire transactions linked to a high-risk geographic (HRG) country.
Number of connections an entity has in a network: This feature contributes 12% to the risk score. Degree centrality measures the number of connections an entity has within a network, which can be indicative of its influence or involvement in complex networks. A high degree centrality may suggest that the entity is well-connected, potentially facilitating or participating in coordinated activities that could pose a risk.
